**Evolutionary optimization for full codebases using agentic coding tools as the mutation engine and git worktrees as the population pool.**

HELIX brings reflective Pareto evolution out of the single-artifact setting and into real software projects: entire repositories, multi-turn agentic mutation, tool use, web research, and verification loops, all inside a single evolutionary stage. Supported mutation backends include Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor Agent, Gemini CLI, and OpenCode.

> **Safety:** HELIX never modifies your working branch, HEAD, staging area, or remote. All mutations live in detached worktrees under `.helix/worktrees/` and branches named `helix/*`. If your checkout is dirty, HELIX snapshots the current tracked and untracked changes into the seed worktree while leaving your original checkout untouched. Run `helix clean` to remove saved state and worktrees when you are done.

---

## Why HELIX?

HELIX is built for a setting that today's evolution systems still do not really handle, including systems like KISS and OpenEvolve: improving **real, multi-file codebases** where useful mutations require exploration, iteration, and tooling, not just a single blind rewrite.

Instead of treating one file or one patch as the candidate, HELIX treats the **entire repository** as the evolving organism. Each mutation is a full agentic coding session running inside an isolated git worktree, so a candidate can:

1. **Read across the codebase** to understand architecture and dependencies.
2. **Edit multiple files coherently** in one mutation.
3. **Use tools mid-mutation** like tests, linters, shell commands, and web search.
4. **Take multiple turns to diagnose and self-correct** before the mutation is scored.
5. **Stay inside one evolutionary stage** rather than requiring an outer orchestration loop to get tool use or iteration.

The result is a new kind of evolutionary optimizer: one that preserves the reflective Pareto-evolutionary core while making it practical for whole repositories and realistic software engineering tasks.

### Coding agent as the mutation engine

The difference between HELIX and `/chat/completions`-style evolvers (GEPA, DSPy-Refine, ShinkaEvolve) is that HELIX's mutation is driven by a **coding agent**, not a single LLM call. A GEPA-style mutation is one prompt → one completion → apply the diff. HELIX's mutation is a full agentic session bounded only by `max_turns`:

| | GEPA / chat-completion evolvers | HELIX |
|---|---|---|
| Mutation shape | Single request/response | Multi-step agentic session |
| Working surface | A single prompt / predictor string | The entire repository in a git worktree |
| Mid-mutation introspection | None | Read any file, grep, glob, `find`, follow imports |
| Mid-mutation verification | None | Run the test suite, type-checker, linter; read failures and react |
| External information | None | Fetch the web, hit GitHub API, query package indexes live |
| Self-correction | None per proposal (retries are separate generations) | Inside one mutation: diagnose a test failure, edit another file, re-run, commit only if green |
| Cost accounting | 1 LLM call = 1 proposal | 1 proposal = N turns, gated by `max_turns` + whatever the agent decides is enough |

This is why `solver/solution.py` on cap-x or a shrinkwrap of a ML kernel on GPT-OSS behave qualitatively differently than a GEPA run on the same task: HELIX's candidate is the program a team of N humans could edit over an afternoon, not a single text blob produced in one shot.

```

**The loop in detail:**

1. **Seed** — Your starting code is copied into a git worktree and evaluated
2. **Evaluate** — Run your evaluator command; parse scores per test/instance
3. **Select** — Pick a parent from the Pareto frontier (weighted by instance wins)
4. **Mutate** — Spawn the configured agent backend in an isolated worktree with full tool access. It reads files, diagnoses failures, makes surgical multi-file edits, and runs commands to verify
5. **Gate** — Re-evaluate on the train set. Reject if the mutation caused regressions
6. **Pareto Update** — Evaluate on the val set and update the Pareto frontier
7. **Merge** — Periodically combine two complementary frontier candidates via the configured backend
8. **Cleanup** — Remove dominated worktrees; persist state; repeat

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/KE7/helix.git
cd helix
pip install -e .

# Verify
helix --help
```

### Initialize a Project

```bash
cd your-project/
helix init
```

This creates a `helix.toml` config file and a `.helix/` directory. Edit `helix.toml` to set your objective and evaluator.

### Whole-repo-as-candidate Model

HELIX treats your **entire working tree** as the candidate. There is no `target_file` — the configured backend may read, edit, create, or delete any file in the project tree during each mutation. A minimal project layout looks like:

```
my-project/
├── helix.toml       # HELIX config (run `helix init` to generate)
├── evaluate.py      # Your evaluator script (must output JSON with a "score" key)
├── solve.py         # File(s) you want to evolve (the backend will find them)
└── ...              # Any other files; HELIX will consider them too
```

To restrict what the backend touches, set `agent.background` in `helix.toml`:

```toml
[agent]
backend = "claude"
# model = "sonnet"  # optional backend-specific model
background = "Only modify files under src/. Do not edit tests/ or config/."
```

### Run Evolution

```bash
helix evolve
```

### View Results

```bash
# Show the Pareto frontier
helix frontier

# Show the best candidate
helix best

# Export best candidate to a directory
helix best --export ./best-solution

# View full mutation log
helix log
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

HELIX is configured via `helix.toml` in your project root.

### Minimal Example

```toml
objective = "Maximize test pass rate and code coverage"

[evaluator]
command = "pytest --tb=short -q"
```

When your evaluator needs project dependencies, make `evaluator.command` use the
same environment those dependencies are installed in. Good patterns are
`uv run python evaluate.py` or a wrapper like `bash run_eval.sh`. Avoid bare
`python3 evaluate.py` unless that interpreter already has everything your
evaluator imports.

### Full Example

```toml
# What you want the code to do better
objective = "Maximize sum of radii of 26 non-overlapping circles packed in a unit square"

# Starting directory (default: current directory)
seed = "."

# RNG seed for deterministic parent selection (default: 0)
rng_seed = 0

[evaluator]
command = "uv run python evaluate.py"
# Available parsers: "pytest" | "exitcode" | "json_accuracy" | "json_score" | "helix_result"
# "helix_result" takes a per-example list matching GEPA optimize_anything's
# `tuple[float, SideInfo] | float` union — each entry is either a bare
# score or a [score, side_info] pair, mixed allowed:
#   HELIX_RESULT=[s_0, s_1, ...]                        # all bare
#   HELIX_RESULT=[[s_0, si_0], [s_1, si_1], ...]        # all rich
#   HELIX_RESULT=[s_0, [s_1, si_1], s_2, ...]           # mixed
# Positional to `helix_batch.json`. HELIX zips it into id-keyed
# `instance_scores` and stores the side_info list for the reflection
# prompt. Use for minibatch runs (`dataset.train_size` set).
score_parser = "json_score"
include_stdout = true

# Cardinality of the train / val splits.  Used by HELIX's minibatch
# sampler to generate example ids (stringified indices by default, or
# opaque "group__N" ids when evolution.batch_sampler = "stratified")

# dataset via helix_batch.json — written as an opaque JSON list[str].
# Leave both unset for single-task mode (legacy full-batch path).
# train_size = 200
# val_size  = 200

[seedless]
# Seedless mode: generate initial candidate from objective via LLM
enabled = false
# Optional prompt-grounding training dataset (used only in seedless
# seed generation).  Accepts a JSON array file, a JSONL file, or a
# directory of JSON files.  When provided, the first 3 examples are

                                 # Default "hybrid" matches GEPA optimize_anything.

### Dataset Modes

HELIX splits dataset concerns across two TOML sections:

| Section | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `[dataset]` | Cardinality only — `train_size` / `val_size` — drives the minibatch sampler when the evaluator owns the dataset and HELIX hands off example ids via `helix_batch.json` (Architecture A). |
| `[seedless]` | Seedless-mode toggle + optional prompt-grounding paths (`train_path` / `val_path`) — used only during seed generation to show the LLM representative inputs. |

| Mode | Config | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Single-task** | neither set | Optimize for a single task. Legacy full-batch evaluator path. |
| **Example-id handoff** | `dataset.train_size` / `dataset.val_size` set | HELIX samples example ids — stringified indices into `range(train_size)` by default, or opaque task-prefixed ids like `"cube_stack__3"` under `evolution.batch_sampler = "stratified"`; the evaluator reads them from `helix_batch.json` (a JSON `list[str]`) in cwd and filters its own dataset. |
| **Seedless multi-task** | `seedless.enabled = true`, `seedless.train_path` set | Seed generation prompt includes the first 3 training examples for grounding. |

HELIX does not own separate dataset files for train/val; your evaluator remains
the source of truth. During evolution HELIX sets `HELIX_SPLIT` (`train` or `val`)
so evaluator-owned datasets can switch behavior by phase, mirroring GEPA's
`trainset` / `valset` duality.

When `evolution.val_stage_size` is set to a positive value and `dataset.val_size` is also set, accepted mutation proposals run a deterministic first-N validation stage before the full validation sweep. Stage-only results are never added to the frontier; HELIX still persists only full-val results for Pareto ranking and resume stability.

### Evaluator Integrity

HELIX can lock evaluator-critical files so mutations and merges cannot game the
score by editing the benchmark itself.

```toml
[evaluator]
command = "uv run python evaluate.py"
score_parser = "json_accuracy"
protected_files = [
  "evaluate.py",
  "goldens.json",
  "helpers/evaluator_utils.py",
]
```

At run start, HELIX hashes the evaluator command target plus any
`evaluator.protected_files` entries and writes the manifest to
`.helix/evaluator_manifest.json`. Candidates that modify any protected file are
rejected before evaluation.

### Per-example Parallelism Inside the Evaluator

HELIX parallelises across proposals (`num_parallel_proposals`) and across
worktrees, but each evaluator invocation sees one candidate and a batch of
instance ids as a single subprocess. Per-example parallelism — evaluating
multiple ids of one candidate concurrently — lives **inside the evaluator**,
not inside HELIX's engine.

This is a deliberate architectural split: GEPA's reference adapter fans out
per-example in-process, which is essentially free; HELIX's subprocess model
would pay full subprocess-startup cost for each example. If you want N-way
parallelism per batch, your `evaluate.py` should do it directly:

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

instance_ids = load_batch_from_helix()   # or argv / HELIX_SPLIT path
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as pool:
    results = dict(zip(instance_ids, pool.map(evaluate_one, instance_ids)))
print(json.dumps({"accuracy": mean(results.values()), "instance_scores": results}))
```

Pick the worker count however you like (constant, CLI arg, derived from
`os.cpu_count()`). HELIX remains agnostic — it just consumes the per-instance
scores the evaluator returns.

### Score Parsers

HELIX includes 4 built-in score parsers to extract metrics from evaluator output:

| Parser | Input | Output | Use Case |
|---|---|---|---|
| **pytest** | Parses `pytest -q` stdout | `scores`: `pass_rate`, `duration`<br>`instance_scores`: per-test pass/fail | Unit test suites |
| **exitcode** | Exit code only | `scores`: `success` (1.0 or 0.0) | Simple pass/fail evaluators |
| **json_accuracy** | JSON stdout with `accuracy` field | `scores`: `accuracy`<br>`instance_scores`: per-instance scores | Classification and benchmark tasks |
| **json_score** | JSON stdout with `score` field | `scores`: `score`<br>`instance_scores`: `score` | Optimization tasks (e.g., circle packing) |

**Example evaluator outputs:**

```python
# json_score parser expects:
print(json.dumps({"score": 2.63}))

# json_accuracy parser expects:
print(json.dumps({
    "accuracy": 0.85,
    "instance_scores": {"puzzle_001": 1.0, "puzzle_002": 0.0}
}))
```

## 🧪 Results

### 🔵 Circle Packing

Pack 26 non-overlapping circles in a unit square, maximizing sum of radii.

| | Score | Config |
|---|:---:|---|
| Seed (naive concentric grid) | 0.9798 | — |
| **HELIX best (gen 14 of 30)** | **2.6360** | `haiku` · `low` effort · `max_turns=20` |

HELIX's core evolutionary algorithm is based on **GEPA optimize_anything** by Agrawal, Lee, Ma, Elmaaroufi, Tan, Seshia, Sen, Klein, Stoica, Gonzalez, Khattab, Dimakis, and Zaharia. Their work on applying reflective Pareto evolution to any text made HELIX possible — we extended their algorithm to full codebases and agentic mutation but the foundation is theirs.
