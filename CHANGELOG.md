# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `DatasetConfig.train_size` / `val_size` — cardinality-only fields that drive
  the minibatch sampler when the evaluator owns the dataset (Architecture A
  example-id handoff).  HELIX writes sampled example ids to
  `{worktree}/helix_batch.json`; the evaluator filters its own dataset.
- `SeedlessConfig` — new section carrying `enabled` plus the optional
  prompt-grounding `train_path` / `val_path` used during seed generation.
- Evaluator-owned dataset integration wired into Architecture A with
  cardinality-only `train_size` / `val_size`.
- `load_config` now emits a dedicated hint for pydantic `extra_forbidden`
  validation errors, pointing users at likely typos or misplaced keys.

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: `score_parser = "helix_result"` now takes a **per-example**
  `HELIX_RESULT=[[score_0, side_info_0], [score_1, side_info_1], ...]`
  payload — one `[score, side_info]` pair per id in `helix_batch.json`.
  HELIX zips it into `instance_scores` and stores `side_info_i` on
  `EvalResult.per_example_side_info` for the reflection prompt.  GEPA
  `optimize_anything` parity (`src/gepa/optimize_anything.py:387-438`).
  The previous scalar-plus-id-keyed-dict contract is removed — it
  silently failed the minibatch gate whenever the evaluator keyed its
  dict by aggregate metric names (`task__metric`) instead of per-example
  ids (`task__trialN`).  Migration: replace
  `HELIX_RESULT=[mean, {"scores": {id_i: v_i, ...}, ...}]` with
  `HELIX_RESULT=[[v_0, {"info": "..."}], [v_1, {...}], ...]`.
- `helix.executor.run_evaluator` now emits a `WARNING` log line when the
  post-filter zero-fills any requested id (naming the count and a sample
  of up to five).  Non-breaking — behaviour is unchanged, only
  observability improves.  Catches parser / id-keying mismatches on
  parsers other than `helix_result` (e.g. `exitcode` plus `instance_ids`).
- **BREAKING**: `seedless` is now a section (`[seedless]` with `enabled = …`),
  not a top-level boolean.
- **BREAKING**: `dataset.train_path` / `dataset.val_path` have moved to
  `seedless.train_path` / `seedless.val_path`.  `[dataset]` is now
  cardinality-only (`train_size` / `val_size`).
- **BREAKING**: `helix_batch.json` payload shape is now `list[str]` instead
  of `list[int]`.  Example ids flow through the Architecture A evaluator
  handoff as opaque strings — the default `_RangeDataLoader` emits `"0"`,
  `"1"`, …, and `StratifiedBatchSampler` emits task-prefixed ids like
  `"cube_stack__3"`.  Evaluators that previously read the handoff as
  `list[int]` must cast on their side
  (`[int(s) for s in json.loads(Path("helix_batch.json").read_text())]`)
  or switch to string-keyed lookup.  Unblocks the stratified sampler on
  Architecture A, which previously died with
  `ValueError: invalid literal for int()` at the serialization boundary.
- **BREAKING**: All pydantic sub-models in `src/helix/config.py`
  (`EvaluatorConfig`, `DatasetConfig`, `SeedlessConfig`, `EvolutionConfig`,
  `ClaudeConfig`, `WorktreeConfig`, `HelixConfig`) now use
  `model_config = ConfigDict(extra="forbid")`.  Unknown / misplaced /
  mistyped TOML keys raise a validation error at load time instead of
  being silently dropped.  Previously, placing `batch_sampler` under
  `[evaluator]` (the key lives on `[evolution]`) silently left users on
  the default sampler with no warning.
